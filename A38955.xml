            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Preſume, er'e this, you have received the Letter I ſent you from our Camp, near the <hi>Boyne.</hi> Since that, you have known by other hands, that by one Fight we have frighted and ſcattered our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and were preſently poſſeſſed of the ſtrong Town of <hi>Droghedah,</hi> and are now as quietly ſetled in this City, yet in much better Condition than was expected. They left Stores filled with Proviſion of Mouth and War: They have great Stores likewiſe in the Country; which are all open for our receipt.</p>
            <p>Their King is run away, with the Duke of <hi>Powis, Tyrconnel,</hi> and ſome few more, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Kingſale;</hi> their Army all ſcattered in the Country; ſo that the War ſeems new to be at an end. <hi>Galloway, Limerick,</hi> and <hi>Athlone</hi> are, as I hear, the only places like to ſtand out againſt us; and having no hopes of Relief, will, as its thought, be eaſily ſurrendred.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty you ſee hath conquered this Kingdom, with a <hi>Veni vidi vici,</hi> it will require more of his trouble to ſettle then to conquer it: I cannot now further enlarge, the Expreſs waiting the motion of my Pen, but to tell you, this day by the Poſt, if poſſible, will ſend you a more particular account.</p>

            <p>I Sent you one of this Date by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and have now to add, That we have ſure and certain Advertiſement ſent us by an Expreſs, that the late King <hi>James</hi> on <hi>Wedneſday</hi>-night laſt embarqued at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cannon,</hi> a Fort that commands Paſſage-Harbour, <hi>viz.</hi> the Harbour of <hi>Waterford;</hi> and that he, Duke <hi>Powis,</hi> and <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> and ſome others, are gone direct for <hi>France.</hi> Their Army are ſcattered in the Country, and are forced to turn Tories to get them a ſupport; ſo that it's believed our King's work will be apply'd now rather to ſettle, then make further Conqueſts here. His Majeſty is not yet come to this Town, but is this Night. Encampt within two Miles of this City, and as we hear, intends to be here to morrow.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtants of <hi>Wexford</hi> hath ſeized that Garriſon, and declare for K. <hi>William</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:108808:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Q. <hi>Mary:</hi> The other Towns where Proteſtants are, will, we expect, follow that Preſident. Of which we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſome Reports, particularly as to <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>Kilkenny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We cannot learn, that there is 5000 of the Enemy in a Body, not underſtand that there are any of them appears within thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Miles of this City. What Forces they lately had of the <hi>Germans</hi> that were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants are come in to us. The <hi>French</hi> are gone with Three Field-Pieces towards <hi>Lymerick,</hi> but its thought they will be met in the way: Our Horſe are now ſcattering to pick up the Scatterers of the Enemies ſcattered Army.</p>
            <p>We all believe, that there will not be ſtruck one ſtroke more in this War; and we have many Reaſons to wiſh and expect it; but none more important, then that we hope thereby our King may return to you, as ſafe as he came to us.</p>
            <p>His active and invincible Courage gave us horrid frights, finding that he acted in the Field, rather as a Couragious Captain, than a great King. This Succeſs may, we hope, juſtly entitle him to the Character of the greateſt Monarch in the European World.</p>
            <p>Our Enemy is run in that haſt, that they have left vaſter Stores than we could have imagined they had, not only of War, but Proviſion behind them.</p>
